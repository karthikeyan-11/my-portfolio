Hello there!

I'm Karthikeyan V, currently learning Git and working on improving my understanding of software tools and electronics. I come from an electronics background and I'm exploring areas like:

- Artificial Intelligence and LLMs
- Python Programming

I'm also interested in animation, visual learning, and tech-based problem solving. This file is part of my Git learning project, and it's fun to see how small changes can be tracked and shared using Git!

Thanks for stopping by my repo!
